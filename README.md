## üìä Data Structure

The application processes Affinity data into the following enhanced structure:

```javascript
{
  leads: [
    {
      id: number,
      entity_id: number,
      entity: object,
      stage: string,
      value: number,
      source: string,
      contactDirection: string,    // "Sean Brown emailed Harry Jones"
      contactType: string,         // "email", "meeting", "event"
      firstEmail: string,          // ISO date string
      leadAge: number,             // Days since first contact
      lastContact: string,         // ISO date string
      field_values: array
    }
  ],
  stages: array,
  sources: array,
  totalValue: number,
  totalLeads: number,
  fields: array
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Stage Weights
- **Range**: 0.0 to 2.0 (0 = excluded, 1 = normal, 2 = double importance)
- **Default**: All stages start at 1.0
- **Persistence**: Weights are saved in browser localStorage

### Default Value Rules

- **Conditional Rules**: Format: "If [Field] = [Value], then default = [Amount]"

- **Type Display**: Shows interaction type for all contact types

## üîß API Endpoints

The application provides several API endpoints that proxy to the Affinity API:

- `GET /api/lists` - Get all available lists
- `GET /api/lists/:listId/list-entries` - Get list entries with field values
- `GET /api/lists/:listId/fields` - Get fields for a specific list
- `GET /api/field-values` - Get field values for entities
- `GET /api/opportunities` - Get opportunities
- `GET /api/pipeline-data` - Get aggregated pipeline data for visualization
- `GET /api/test-fields/:listId` - Test and categorize fields by type

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Field Types
To support additional field types, modify the field processing logic in `public/app.js`.

### Changing Color Schemes
Update the `colorSchemes` object in `public/app.js` to customize colors for different data types.

### Modifying Contact Logic
Edit the contact direction and type extraction logic to handle new interaction types.

### Custom Calculations
Add new metrics by extending the calculation functions in `public/app.js`.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to load lists"**
   - Check that your API key is correct
   - Ensure your Affinity account has API access enabled
   - Verify the API key has the necessary permissions

2. **"No data displayed"**
   - Make sure you've selected the correct fields
   - Check that your list contains leads with the selected stage field
   - Verify that the value field contains numeric data

3. **"Contact information not showing"**
   - Ensure the "Last Contact" relationship-intelligence field is available
   - Check that leads have recent contact activity
   - Verify field permissions in Affinity

4. **"Lead age not calculating"**
   - Select the correct "First Email" field
   - Ensure the field contains valid date data
   - Check field permissions and data availability

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging:
1. Click the "Debug Mode" button in the interface, or
2. Add this to your browser console:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
   ```

### Console Logs
The application provides detailed console logging for:
- Field processing and mapping
- Contact direction extraction
- Lead age calculations
- API responses and errors

## üèóÔ∏è Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with nodemon for automatic restarts during development.
